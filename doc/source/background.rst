coming out of a water body. The following picture shows these flows:

For some flows both the english and dutch term are given. We explain some of
these flows:

discharge
  flow that is generated by a pumping station [#fn1]_ that either pumps water
  into or out of the water body.

flow off
  incoming flow that is generated by a surplus of water on the areas that
  surround the water body

indraft
  incoming flow that trickles through the ground and that stems from areas that
  surround the water body

drainage
  incoming flow that trickles through the ground and goes to the areas that
  surround the water body

.. [#fn1] in dutch, "kunstwerk"
